# Linux

Linux is a kernel designed to be similar to the original Unix kernel, but modern, free and open source. It is built to work on many modern processor architectures including the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of i386. This is also used to generally describe the many operating systems that use the Linux kernel. [1]

## Linux - Modules

The kernel is composed of a large number of modules. These can be found here:

```
/lib/modules/<KERNEL_VERSION>/
```

View all of the loaded modules:
```
# lsmod
```

Custom modules can be compiled for a specific kernel and copied in their respective driver directory. A few common drivers types are "iscsi", "net/ethernet", "net/wireless", "usb", "pci", "video", etc.
```
/lib/modules/<KERNEL_VERSION>/kernel/drivers/<DRIVER_TYPE>/
```

After copying over the necessary *.ko file(s) for custom modules, load
```
# depmod <MODULE>
```

If there are a large number of new modules, it is possible to make sure all module dependencies are installed.
```
# depmod --all
```

Modules can be temporarily loaded:
```
# modprobe <MODULE>
```

Or permanently add the module to a file with the extension ".conf" in the modules load directory.
```
/etc/modules-load.d/*.conf
```

Modules can be deactivated by running one of these two commands:
```
# rmmod <MODULE>
```
```
# modprobe -r <MODULE>
```

Modules can also be blocked from starting on boot:
```
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```
```
blacklist <MODULE>
```

## Linux - I/O Schedulers

The kernel provides many input/output (I/O) schedulers to configure how a hard drive handles a queue of read/write requests from the operating system. Different schedulers can be used to adjust performance based on the hardware and/or software requirements.

* Deadline = Large I/O requests are done in high-priority sectors until smaller I/O requests are about to time out. Then Deadline takes care of the small tasks before continuing with the original large I/O task. This is ideal for heavy read/write applications on a spinning disk drive.
* Complete Fairness Queueing (CFQ) = All I/O requests are treated equally and are handled in the order that they are received. [1]
* NOOP = Only basic merging of read and/or write requests and no rescheduling. This is ideal for virtual drives (such as QCOW2) where the hypervisor node handles the I/O scheduling. [2] This is also ideal for physical flash based media where the hardware's firmware takes care of the sorting. [1]

Temporarily change the scheduler to one of the three options:
```
# echo {deadline|cfg|noop} > /sys/block/<DEVICE>/queue/scheduler
```

Permanently change the scheduler by appending the existing GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX kernel arguments:
```
# vim /etc/default/grub
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="elevator={deadline|cfg|noop}"
# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

# Initial RAM Filesystem

The initramfs (initial RAM filesystem) is used to boot up a system before loading the full Linux kernel. It is the successor to the initrd (initial RAM disk). A boot loader, such as GRUB, loads the initramfs first. This usually contains a minimum copy of the kernel and drivers required to boot up the system. Once the boot initialization is complete, the initramfs continues to load all of the available kernel modules. [1][2]

## Initial RAM Filesystem - Arch Linux

All modifications of the initramfs in Arch Linux are handled by the "mkinitcpio" utility.

```
/etc/mkinitcpio.conf
```

* MODULES = A list of kernel modules to compile in.
* FILES = A list of files that should be included in the initramfs.
* BINARIES = A list of binaries that should be included to use in the initramfs environment. This is useful for having more recovery utilities. The "mkinitcpio" program will automatically detect the binary's dependencies and add them to the initramfs image.
* HOOKS = Custom hooks for compiling in certain software packages.
    * Common hooks:
        * btrfs = BtrFS RAID.
        * net = Add networking.
        * mdadm = mdadm software RAID modules.
        * fsck = FSCK utilies for available operating systems.
        * encrypt = LUKS encyrption modules.
        * lvm2 = Logical volume manager (LVM) modules.
        * shutdown = Allows the initramfs to properly shutdown.

Create a new initramfs.
```
# mkinitcpio
```

## Initial RAM Filesystem - RHEL

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) based operating systems (such as RHEL itself, CentOS, and Fedora), Dracut is used to manage the initramfs.

```
/etc/dracut.conf
```

* add_drivers+= A list of kernel modules to compile in.
* install_items+= A list of files to compile in.
* add_dracutmodules+= A list of Dracut modules to compile.
