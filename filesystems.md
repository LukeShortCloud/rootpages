### BtrFS
BtrFS stands for the "B-tree filesystem." The file system is commonly referred to as "BtreeFS", "ButterFS", and "BetterFS". In this model, data is organized efficently for fast I/O operations. This helps to provide copy-on-write (CoW) for efficent file copies as well as other useful features. BtrFS supports subvolumes, CoW snapshots, online defragementation, built-in RAID, compression, and the ability to upgrade an existing ext file systems to BtrFS [1].

#### BtrFS Mount Options
Common options include:
* autodefrag = Automatically defragement the file system. This can negatively impact performance.
* compress = File system compression can be used. Valid options are:
  * zlib = Higher compression
  * lzo = Faster file system performance
  * no = Disable compression (default)
* notreelog = Disable journaling. This may improve performance but can result in a loss of the file system if power is lost.
* subvolume = Mount a subvolume contained inside a BtrFS file system.
* ssd = Enables various solid state drive optimizations. This does not turn on TRIM support.
* discard = Enables TRIM support. [1]

#### BtrFS RAIDs
In the latest Linux kernels, all RAID types (0, 1, 5, 6, and 10) are supported. [1]

#### BtrFS Limitations
Known limitations:
* The "df" (disk free) command does not report an accurate disk usage due to BtrFS's fragmentation. Instead, "btrfs filesystem df" should be used to view disk space usage on mount points and "btrfs filesystem show" for partitions.
  * For freeing up space, run a block-level and then a file-level defragmentation. Then the disk space usage should be accurate to df's output. [1]
    * \# btrfs balance start /
    * \# btrfs defragment -r /
