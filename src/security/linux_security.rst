Permissions
-----------

User, Group, and Other
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normal Linux file permissions are grouped into three categories: owner,
group, and other users access. Permissions can be defined for what the
user, group, or anyone else can do to the file. This can be defined with
letters or numbers.

-  read (r,4) = Read access.
-  write (w,2) = Write access.
-  execute (x,1) = Executable access.

The addition of these numbers makes up the entire access. For example,
"rwx" would equal "777." [1]

::

    -rwxr-xr--. 1 root bob 0 Oct 22 13:11 example_file.txt

::

    user (root): rwx = 7
    group (bob): r-x = 5
    other: r-- = 4

These permissions can be modified with the "chmod" command.

Example (numbers):

.. code-block:: sh

    $ chmod 775

Example (letters):

.. code-block:: sh

    $ chmod g+w,o+x

Authentication
--------------

Kerberos
~~~~~~~~

Kerberos provides authentication for services over a network. A Kerberos
server provides remote users with a "ticket" to use after they log in.
This ticket is used to validate authentication with various services
including FTP, SSH, NFS, etc. [2]

Ports:

-  88 TCP/UDP
-  464 TCP/UDP
-  749 TCP/UDP
-  6620 TCP/UDP
-  6621 TCP/UDP
-  6623 TCP/UDP [3]

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Kerberos sever is referred to as the Kerberos Distribution Center
(KDC). These packages will need to be installed for the service:

RHEL:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ sudo yum install krb5-server krb5-workstation pam_krb5

Debian:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ sudo apt-get install krb5-kdc krb5-admin-server libpam-krb5

The principal database needs to be generated. First replace
"EXAMPLE.COM" with the domain to be used. For this example, the realm
"ROOTPAGES.TLD" will be used.

-  /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf

.. code-block:: ini

    [kdcdefaults]
    kdc_ports = 88
    kdc_tcp_ports = 88
    [realms]
    ROOTPAGES.TLD = {
     #master_key_type = aes256-cts
     acl_file = /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl
     dict_file = /usr/share/dict/words
     admin_keytab = /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab
     supported_enctypes = aes256-cts:normal aes128-cts:normal des3-hmac-sha1:normal arcfour-hmac:normal camellia256-cts:normal camellia128-cts:normal des-hmac-sha1:normal des-cbc-md5:normal des-cbc-crc:normal
    }

-  /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/adm5.acl

   ::

       */admin@ROOTPAGES.TLD   *

The principal is made by running the command below. It will create a new
database and associated files for the realm "ROOTPAGES.TLD."

.. code-block:: sh

    $ sudo kdb5_util create -s -r ROOTPAGES.TLD

Uncomment all of the lines in /etc/krb5.conf and then replace all
references to "example.com" and EXAMPLE.COM" with the server's domain
name/realm. [3] For testing, "rdns=false" and
"ignore\_acceptor\_hostname=true" in the "[libdefaults]" section should
be used to prevent DNS issues. [5]

.. code-block:: ini

    [logging]
    default = FILE:/var/log/krb5libs.log
    kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log
    admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmind.log

    [libdefaults]
    dns_lookup_realm = false
    ticket_lifetime = 24h
    renew_lifetime = 7d
    forwardable = true
    rdns = false
    default_realm = ROOTPAGES.TLD
    default_ccache_name = KEYRING:persistent:%{uid}

    [realms]
    ROOTPAGES = {
     kdc = kdc.rootpages.tld
     admin_server = kdc.rootpages.tld
    }

    [domain_realm]
    .rootpages.tld = ROOTPAGES.TLD
    rootpages.tld = ROOTPAGES.TLD

Start the KDC service.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ sudo systemctl start krb5kdc

Optionally, the admin authentication service can be started to allow
remote management.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ sudo systemctl start kadmin

Now define the root user and KDC host as allowed principals.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ sudo kadmin.local -p root/admin

::

    kadmin: addprinc root/admin
    kdamin: addprinc -randkey host/kdc.rootpages.tld

Additional Kerberos users can also be created.

::

    kadmin: addprinc <USER>

Allow Kerberos authentication via SSH.

File: /etc/ssh/sshd_config

::

    GSSAPIAuthentication yes
    GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

File: /etc/ssh/ssh_config

::

    Host *
       GSSAPIAuthentication yes
       GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes

.. code-block:: sh

    $ sudo systemctl reload sshd

Allow remote authentication through this KDC.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ sudo authconfig --enablekrb5 --update

Verify that the authentication works.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ sudo su - <USER>
    $ kinit <USER>
    $ klist

SSL/TLS Certificates
--------------------

SSL/TLS certificates provide a symmetric key-pair, similar to SSH keys. SSL is an older protocol that is vulnerable and no longer supported. It was succeeded by TLS.

A TLS cipher suite consist of 4 different alogirthms: (1) the key exchange, (2) the authentication, (3) the bulk encyrption, and (4) message authentication code (MAC). A server defines what cipher suite it supports. A client that connects to a server negotiates for a cipher suite that it is compatible with and then uses that for securely connecting. [6]

-  Key exchange = Encrypt both of the symmetric keys.
-  Authentication = Sign and verify certificates.
-  Bulk encyrption = Encrypt data to and from a server. A key generated with this alogrithm requires a password.
-  MAC = Checks the integrity of the data being sent and received.

Top alogithms [7]:

-  Key exchange:

   1. ECDHE
   2. RSA

-  Authentication:

   1. ECDSA
   2. RSA

-  Bulk encryption:

   1. AES256-GCM
   2. CHACHA20
   3. AES128-GCM
   4. AES256
   5. AES128

-  MAC:

   1. SHA384
   2. POLY1305
   3. SHA256

Certificate Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Self-signed certificates and keys can be manually created. Web browsers and tools will show these as unverified since a trusted certificate authority (CA) did not sign the certificate. The benefit is that secure TLS connections can still be used.

-  Create a CA key.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096

-  Create a root certificate.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -days 365 -out ca.crt -subj "/C=<COUNTRY_CODE>/ST=<STATE_NAME>/L=<CITY_NAME>/O=<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/OU=<ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT_NAME>/CN=<FQDN>"

[8]

-  Create a symmetric key-pair. This file will be used as the private key file.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ openssl genrsa -out cert.key 4096

-  Optionally, extract the public key from it.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ openssl rsa -in cert.key -pubout -out cert.pub

-  Create a certificate signing request (CSR). This will be used by a CA to sign the certificate.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ openssl req -new -key cert.key -out cert.csr -subj "/C=<COUNTRY_CODE>/ST=<STATE_NAME>/L=<CITY_NAME>/O=<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/OU=<ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT_NAME>/CN=<FQDN>"

[9]

-  Create a self-signed certificate signed by the CA.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ openssl x509 -req -in cert.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out cert.crt -days 365

[8]

-  Verify that the information for the certificate is correct.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ openssl x509 -noout -text -in cert.crt

[9]

Trusted Certificate Authorities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom certificate authorities (CAs) can be added as known trusted CAs.

Arch Linux [10]:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo cp ca.crt /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/
   $ sudo update-ca-trust

Debian [11]:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo cp ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
   $ sudo update-ca-certificates

Fedora [11]:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo cp ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
   $ sudo update-ca-trust
