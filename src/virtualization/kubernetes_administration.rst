Architecture
------------

Kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~

Kubernetes, also known as k8s, is an open-source container management platform. It handles the life-cycle of Pods which are a collection of related containers required to run an application. Kubernetes clusters contain two types of servers:

-  Control Plane Node (previously known as Master Node) = Manages the state of the Nodes and their Pods.
-  Worker Node (previously known as Node, Worker, Worker Machines, or Minion) = Run user applications in containers and respond to requests from the Control Plane Nodes.

Control Plane Node services:

-  etcd = The most common database for storing all of the Kubernetes configuration data.
-  kube-apiserver = Handles authentication requests and retrieving/storing data from/to etcd.
-  kube-controller-manager = Monitors and controls Kubernetes resources. It will perform recovery tasks if a failure is detected. This binary runs many different controller processes:

   -  attachdetach, bootstrapsigner, cloud-node-lifecycle, clusterrole-aggregation, cronjob, csrapproving, csrcleaner, csrsigning, daemonset, deployment, disruption, endpoint, endpointslice, garbagecollector, horizontalpodautoscaling, job, namespace, nodeipam, nodelifecycle, persistentvolume-binder, persistentvolume-expander, podgc, pv-protection, pvc-protection, replicaset, replicationcontroller, resourcequota, root-ca-cert-publisher, route, service, serviceaccount, serviceaccount-token, statefulset, tokencleaner, ttl, ttl-after-finished [18]

-  kube-scheduler = Determines what Node to schedule a Pod on.

Worker Node services:

-  Container runtime = Any service for executing containers that supports the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). Kubernetes officially supports containerd, CRI-O, and docker. [42]
-  kubelet = Manages containers using the container runtime.
-  kube-proxy = Handles virtual networking connections for internal (containers across different Nodes) and external (Kubernetes Services) use.

[1]

Networking
^^^^^^^^^^

Pod Networking
''''''''''''''

Kubernetes requires a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin to create an overlay network for inter-communication between Pods across all of the Control Plane and Worker Nodes. The default Pod network CIDR (as configured by ``kubeadm --pod-network-cidr``) is normally assumed to be 10.244.0.0/16.

Ports
'''''

Depending on the role of the Node and what Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin is used, different ports need to be opened in the firewall.

Control Plane Nodes:

OpenShift
~~~~~~~~~

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) is an enterprise product based on Google's Kubernetes. [16] It has a stronger focus on security with support for having access control lists (ACLs) for managing containers in separate projects and full SELinux support. It also provides more features to extend Kubernetes functionality.

The Origin Kubernetes Distribution (OKD), originally known as OpenShift Origin, is the free and open source community edition of RHOCP. [4] OKD 4.5 was the first stable release for the 4.Y series. [21] It supports being deployed ontop of Red Hat CoreOS and Fedora CoreOS. [21]

OpenShift has 3 primary architectures:

-  Single Node (OKD only) = Proof-of-concept deployments with all OpenShift services running on a single Node.
-  Three Node = Edge deployments using multiple Single Nodes.
-  Full = Production deployments (recommended minimum requirements). [23]

   -  x3 Control Nodes
   -  x2 Logging and monitoring Nodes
   -  x3 Routing Nodes
   -  x2 Worker Nodes

Node types and services:

-  Control = These Nodes have to be deployed using Red Hat CoreOS (RHOCP) or Fedora CoreOS (OKD). [24] All other Nodes can use RHEL (RHOCP) or Fedora (OKD).

   -  etcd
   -  kube-api
   -  kube-controller-manager

-  Logging and Monitoring [25]

   -  EFK stack

      -  Fluentd = Log collection.
      -  Elasticsearch = Log storage.
      -  Kibana = Visualization.

   -  Curator = Log filtering (based on timestamps) in OpenShift < 4.5.

-  Router = This Node is optional and is combined with the Control Node by default. [26]

   -  Ingress = HAProxy and/or F5 BIG-IP.

-  Worker/Compute = The life-cycle of these Nodes are handled by the MachineSet API. Control Plane Nodes do not use the MachineSet API as to prevent accidental deletion of the control plane. [24]

   -  CRI-O (container runtime)
   -  kubelet

Supported infrastructure for installing OpenShift on [27]:

-  Public cloud

   -  Amazon Web Services (AWS)
   -  Google Compute Platform (GCP)
   -  Microsoft Azure

-  On-site

   -  Bare metal
   -  OpenStack
   -  Red Hat Virtualization (RHV)
   -  VMWare vSphere

PersistentVolume support [3]:

-  AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)
-  Azure Disk
-  Azure File
-  Cinder
-  Container Storage Interface (CSI) = Any storage provider that uses CSI as a front-end can be used with OpenShift.
-  Fibre Channel
-  Google Compute Engine (GCE) Persistent Disk
-  HostPath
-  iSCSI
-  Local volume
-  NFS
-  Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (Ceph RBD)
-  VMWare vSphere

Tanzu
~~~~~

Tanzu (pronounced tawn-zoo) Kubernetes Grid (TKG) is developed by VMware as a collection of different products to install upstream Kubernetes.

There are currently three offerings for TKG [54]:

-  **TKG Multicloud (TKGm)** = TKGm supports creating and managing infrastructure on Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and VMware vSphere 6. For VMware vSphere 7, TKGm can be used but TKGS is recommended instead.
-  **TKG Services (TKGS)** = VMware vSphere 7 creates and manages the Kubernetes cluster.
-  **TKG Integrated Edition (TKGI)** = Previosuly Enterprise PKS. Uses BOSH to deploy and manage virtual machines for the Kubernetes cluster. BOSH supports creating infrastructure on Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack, and VMware vSphere. [55]

TKGm
^^^^

TKGm stands for TKG Multicloud. It is a product for installing Kubernetes on-top of virtual infrastructure provided by AWS, Azure, GCE, or VMware vSphere. It first deploys an all-in-one TKG Management Cluster using `kind <https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/>`__. This then uses the `Cluster API <https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/>`__ to deploy and manage one or more production Kubernetes clouds. [32]

OpenShift
~~~~~~~~~

Below is a list of RHOCP and OKD versions that correspond with the upstream Kubernetes release. The RHOCP 4.0 release was skipped and used for internal testing only. RHOCP 4 introduced Operators and OperatorHub. It also requires all Control Plane Nodes to be installed on Red Hat CoreOS. [5]

.. csv-table::
   :header: RHOCP/OKD, Kubernetes
   :widths: 20, 20

   4.5, 1.18

   1.0.0, 1.17.3

Installation
------------

Minikube
~~~~~~~~

Minikube deploys a virtual machine with Kubernetes pre-installed as a test environment for developers. This is only supported on x86_64 processors.

Download the latest Minikube release from `here <https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases>`__.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ MINIKUBE_VER=1.8.2
   $ sudo curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/download/v${MINIKUBE_VER}/minikube-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/minikube
   $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minikube

Optionally install a driver such as KVM2. The ``minikube`` installer will automatically download it if it cannot be found.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/download/v${MINIKUBE_VER}/docker-machine-driver-kvm2 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-kvm2
   $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-kvm2

Deploy Kubernetes. Optionally specify the Kubernetes version to use. If using the ``kvm2`` driver as the root user, the ``--force`` argument is also required.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ minikube start --vm-driver kvm2 --kubernetes-version ${KUBERNETES_VERSION}

[7]

kubeadm
~~~~~~~

Supported operating systems:

-  Debian >= 9, Ubuntu >= 16.04
-  Fedora >= 25
-  Flatcar Container Linux
-  HypriotOS >= 1.0.1
-  RHEL/CentOS >= 7

The official ``kubeadm`` utility is used to quickly create production environments and manage their life-cycle. This tool had became stable and supported since the Kubernetes 1.13 release. [8] Install it using the instructions found `here <https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/>`__. Other pre-requisite steps include disabling swap partitions, enabling IP forwarding, and installing docker. On RHEL/CentOS, SELinux needs to be disabled as it is not supported for use with kubeadm.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo swapoff --all

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo modprobe br_netfilter
   $ echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
   $ sudo sysctl -p

Install Kubernetes. This will bootstrap a ``kubelet`` container which will read manifest files to create all of the other required services as containers.

Syntax for a single Control Plane Node:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16

Syntax for the first of many Control Plane Nodes (take note of the ``[upload-certs] Using certificate key`` message that will appear as it will be required later):

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16 --upload-certs --control-plane-endpoint <LOAD_BALANCED_IP>:6443

Although it is `possible to change the Control Plane endpoint <https://blog.scottlowe.org/2019/08/12/converting-kubernetes-to-ha-control-plane/>`__ for a highly available cluster, it is not recommended. Ensure it is configured to a load balanced IP address and not just a single IP address of one of the Control Plane Nodes.

Load the administrator Kubernetes configuration file as root and continue. Otherwise, copy the configuration file to the local user.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ su -
   # export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

.. code-block:: sh

   $ mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
   $ sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
   $ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Install the Canal (Flannel and Calico) Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins. Otherwise, the first Control Plane Node will be stuck in the "NotReady" state as seen by ``kubectl get nodes``.

Flannel [48]:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/coreos/flannel/raw/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml

Calico [49]:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/canal.yaml

Create an authentication token if the original deployment token expired.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubeadm token list
   $ kubeadm token create

Look-up the discovery token hash by using the certificate authority file.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ openssl x509 -pubkey -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt | openssl rsa -pubin -outform der 2>/dev/null | openssl dgst -sha256 -hex | sed 's/^.* //'

On the Worker Nodes, add them to the cluster by running:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo kubeadm join --token <TOKEN> <MASTER_IP_ADDRESS>:6443 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<HASH>

Optionally allow Control Plane Nodes to also run Pods.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-

[9]

k3s
~~~

k3s was created by Rancher Labs as a simple way to deploy small Kubernetes clusters quickly. It supports both x86 and ARM processors. It uses the ``containerd`` runtime by default, CoreDNS for hostname resolution and management, and Flannel for networking. All of the tools and resources are provided in a single ``k3s`` binary. All beta and alpha features of Kubernetes have been removed to keep the binary small.

Pre-requisites:

`cgroupsv2 were not supported until v1.20.4+ks1 <https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/1825>`__. For older releases, force the use of cgroupsv1 and then reboot the Node.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo vim /etc/default/grub
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory"
   $ sudo update-grub

Common installation environment variables [50]:

-  INSTALL_K3S_VERSION = The version of k3s to install. Specify a `k3s tag from GitHub <https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/tags>`__.
-  INSTALL_K3S_CHANNEL = ``stable`` (default), ``latest``, or ``testing``. The current version tied to the channel is listed `here <https://update.k3s.io/v1-release/channels>`__.
-  K3S_URL = The Control Plane endpoint URL to connect to. The URL is provided after a successful installation of the first Control Plane Node. This variable will also set the Node to become a Worker Node.
-  K3S_TOKEN = Required for the Worker Node. The token credential to connect to the Kubernetes cluster.

The installation script will download the ``k3s`` binary, setup the systemd unit file, enable the service (``k3s`` for Control Plane Nodes and ``k3s-agent`` for Worker Nodes), then start the service.

Control Plane Node:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_CHANNEL=latest sh -

Find the token:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token

Worker Nodes:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_TOKEN=<TOKEN> K3S_URL=https://<MASTER_HOST>:6443 INSTALL_K3S_CHANNEL=latest sh -

**Commands**

Access the ``kubectl`` command through ``k3s`` to manage resources on the cluster.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo k3s kubectl --help

For using the ``kubectl`` command on other systems, copy the configuration from the Control Plane Node.

.. code-block:: sh

kind
~~~~

kind is a tool written in Go that is used by the upstream Kubernetes developers. It simulates different Kubernetes nodes via the use of containers on a single local workstation.

Installation:

-  All operating systems:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ GO111MODULE="on" go get sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.9.0

-  macOS specific:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ brew install kind

Usage:

-  Create a cluster:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ kind create cluster

-  Or create a cluster using a specific tag from `here <https://hub.docker.com/r/kindest/node/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated>`__:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ kind create cluster --image kindest/node:<TAG>

-  Or create a cluster using a Kubernetes manifest file for the Cluster API:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ kind create cluster --config=<CLUSTER_MANIFEST>.yaml

-  Configure kubectl to use the cluster by default:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

[45]

OpenShift Ansible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenShift Ansible project is an official collection of Ansible playbooks to manage the installation and life-cycle of production OpenShift clusters.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible.git
   $ cd openshift-ansible
   $ git checkout release-3.11

Settings for the deployment are defined in a single inventory file. Examples can be found in the ``inventory`` directory. ``[OSEv3:children]`` is a group of groups that should contain all of the hosts.

Inventory file variables:

-  ``openshift_deployment_type`` = ``origin`` for the upstream OKD on CentOS or ``openshift-enterprise`` for the downstream OCP on Red Hat CoreOS.
-  ``openshift_release`` = The OpenShift release to use. Example: ``v3.11``.
-  ``openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'htpasswd_auth', 'login': 'true', 'challenge': 'true', 'kind': 'HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider'}]`` = Enable htpasswd authentication.
-  ``openshift_master_htpasswd_users={'<USER1>': '<HTPASSWD_HASH>', '<USER2>': '<HTPASSWD_HASH>'}`` = Configure OpenShift users. Create a password for the user by running ``htpasswd -nb <USER> <PASSWORD>``.
-  ``openshift_disable_check=memory_availability,disk_availability`` = Disable certain checks for a minimal lab deployment.
-  ``openshift_master_cluster_hostname`` = The private internal hostname.
-  ``openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname`` = The public internal hostname.

[15]

The container registry is ephemeral so after a reboot the data will be wiped. All of the storage inventory configuration options and settings can be found `here <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install/configuring_inventory_file.html#advanced-install-registry>`__. For lab environments using NFS, unsupported options will need to be enabled using ``openshift_enable_unsupported_configurations=True``. The ``nfs`` group will also need to be created and added to the ``OSEv3:children`` group of groups.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo yum -y ansible pyOpenSSL python-cryptography python-lxml
   $ sudo ansible-playbook -i <INVENTORY_FILE> playbooks/prerequisites.yml
   $ sudo ansible-playbook -i <INVENTORY_FILE> playbooks/deploy_cluster.yml

Persistent container application storage can also be configured after installation by using one of the configurations from `here <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/persistent_storage/index.html>`__.

Uninstall OpenShift services from Nodes by specifying them in the inventory and using the uninstall playbook.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo ansible-playbook -i <INVENTORY_FILE> playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml

Tanzu
~~~~~

TKGm
^^^^

Before installing a Kubernetes cloud with Tanzu, the ``tkg`` utility has to be set up.

-  Install both ``docker`` and ``kubectl``.
-  Download the Tanzu-related binaries from `here <https://www.vmware.com/go/get-tkg>`__. A VMWare account is required to login and download it.
-  Extract the binaries:  ``tar -v -x -f tkg-linux-amd64-v${TKG_VERSION}-vmware.1.tar.gz``
-  Move them into an executable location in ``$PATH``: ``chmod +x ./tkg/* && mv ./tkg/* ~/.local/bin/``
-  Symlink the ``tkg`` binary: ``ln -s ~/.local/bin/tkg-linux-amd64-v${TKG_VERSION}+vmware.1 ~/.local/bin/tkg``
-  Verify that ``tkg`` works: ``tkg-linux-amd64-<VERSION>+vmware.1 version``.
-  Create the configuration files in ``~/.tkg/`` by running: ``tkg get management-cluster``

[34]

AWS
'''

Setup a TKG Management Cluster and then the production Kubernetes cluster using infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

-  Install ``jq``.
-  Install the dependencies for the ``aws`` command: ``glibc``, ``groff``, and ``less``.
-  Install the ``aws`` utility and verify it works. Find the latest version from `here <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/v2/CHANGELOG.rst>`__. [35]

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ export AWS_CLI_VERSION="2.0.59"
      $ curl -O "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64-${AWS_CLI_VERSION}.zip"
      $ unzip awscli-*.zip
      $ sudo ./aws/install
      $ aws --version

-  Generate a SSH key pair: ``aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name default --output json | jq .KeyMaterial -r > default.pem``
-  Kubernetes installation:

    -  Creat the AWS CloudFormation stack and then initialize/create the TKG Management Cluster. [36]

       .. code-block:: sh

          # CLI setup.
          $ export AWS_REGION=<REGION>
          $ export AWS_SSH_KEY_NAME="default"
          $ tkg config permissions aws
          $ tkg init --infrastructure aws --plan [dev|prod]

       .. code-block:: sh

          # Alternatively, use the web dashboard setup.
          $ tkg init --ui

   -  Optionally create a configuration file for the production Kubernetes cluster. By default, the "dev" plan will create one Control Plane Node and the "prod" plan will create three. Both will create one Worker Node.

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ tkg config cluster <KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME> --plan [dev|prod] --controlplane-machine-count <CONTROLPLANE_COUNT> --worker-machine-count <WORKER_COUNT> --namespace <NAMESPACE> > ~/.tkg/cluster_config.yaml

   -  Deploy the production Kubernetes cluster and give it a unique and descriptive name. [37]

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ tkg create cluster <KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME> --plan [dev|prod] --kubernetes-version=v1.19.1

   -  Verify that the production Kubernetes cluster can now be accessed. [38]

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ tkg get cluster
         $ tkg get credentials <KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME>
         Credentials of workload cluster '<KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME>' have been saved
         You can now access the cluster by running 'kubectl config use-context <KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME>-admin@<KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME>'
         $ kubectl config use-context <KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME>-admin@<KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME>
         $ kubectl get nodes -o wide
         $ kubectl get -n kube-system pods

TKGS
^^^^

Applications
''''''''''''

Harbor
&&&&&&

**IMPORTANT:** The version of Harbor provided by TKGS in VMware vSphere <= 7.0U2 is an older version and lacks many of the features found in the upstream release. It only provides basic push and pull capabilities. It is recommended to install the Helm chart instead.

Enable Harbor in TKGS [67]:

-  vSphere Client > Workload Management > Clusters > (select the workload cluster) > Configure > Namespaces > Image Registry > Embedded Harbor: ENABLE

Each Kubernetes Namespace will now have two secrets created: a pull and push Secret. These are named ``<VSPHERE_NAMESPACE>-default-image-[pull|push]-secret``. In the specification of a Pod, use the pull Secret in ``pod.spec.imagePullSecrets.name``. When interacting with the container registry manually via ``docker login``, use a vSphere user that has "edit" permissions with the cluster. [68]

Uninstall
---------

CodeReady Containers (CRC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop CRC, delete the virtual machine, and cleanup system-wide configuration changes the installer made. Then delete all of the CRC files or at least remove the ``~/.crc/cache/`` directory to free up storage space.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ crc stop
   $ crc delete
   $ crc cleanup
   $ rm -rf ~/.crc/

kubeadm
~~~~~~~

Any Node provisioned with ``kubeadm init`` or ``kubeadm join`` can uninstall Kubernetes.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo kubeadm reset
   $ sudo rm -f /etc/cni/net.d/*
   $ sudo ipvsadm --clear

Reset the ``iptables`` rules [51]:

         $ tkg delete management-cluster <TKG_MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER>

Upgrade
-------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrades can be done from one minor or patch release to another. Minor version upgrades cannot skip a version. For example, upgrading from 1.17.0 to 1.18.4 can be done but from 1.17.0 to 1.19.0 will not work. [30]

Compatibility guarantees differ between services [31]:

-  kube-apiserver = No other component in the cluster can have a minor version higher than this.
-  kubelet and kube-proxy = Supports two versions behind the kube-apiserver.
-  cloud-controller-manager, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler = Supports one version behind kube-apiserver.
-  kubectl (client) = Supports one version older than, later than, or equal to the kube-apiserver.

Common upgrade scenarios (for a Kubernetes and/or operating system upgrade), in order of recommendation:

1.  Upgrade one Node at a time. Workloads will be migrated off the Node.

    -  Use ``kubectl drain`` to remove all workloads from the Node.
    -  Once the upgrade is complete, use ``kubectl uncordon`` to allow workloads to be scheduled on the Node again.

2.  Upgrade one Node at a time to new hardware. Workloads will be migrated off the Node.

    -  Use ``kubectl drain`` to remove all workloads from the old Node.
    -  Use ``kubectl delete node`` to delete the old Node.

3.  Upgrade all Nodes at the same time. This will cause downtime.

Minikube
~~~~~~~~

Minikube can be upgraded by starting with a specified Kubernetes version (or use "latest"). [29]

.. code-block:: sh

   $ minikube stop
   $ minikube start --kubernetes-version=<VERSION>

kubeadm
~~~~~~~

Control Plane Nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check for a newer version of ``kubeadm``.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ apt update
   $ apt-cache madison kubeadm

Update ``kubeadm`` to the desired Kubernetes version to upgrade to.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubeadm=<KUBERNETES_PACKAGE_VERSION>

View the modifications that a ``kubeadm upgrade`` would make.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo kubeadm upgrade plan

Upgrade to the specified ``X.Y.Z`` version on the first Control Plane Node

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo kubeadm upgrade apply vX.Y.Z

Log into the other Control Plane Nodes and upgrade those.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo kubeadm upgrade node vX.Y.Z

Upgrade the ``kubelet`` service on all of the Control Plane Nodes.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubelet=<KUBERNETES_PACKAGE_VERSION> kubectl=<KUBERNETES_PACKAGE_VERSION>
   $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   $ sudo systemctl restart kubelet

[30]

Worker Nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update ``kubeadm``.

Drain all objects from one of the Worker Nodes.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets <NODE>

Upgrade the Worker Node.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo kubeadm upgrade node

Upgrade the ``kubelet`` service.

Allow objects to be scheduled onto the Node again.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl uncordon <NODE>

Verify that all Nodes have the "READY" status.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl get nodes

[30]

k3s
~~~

Either update the local git repository and checkout the desired version tag to upgrade to or curl the latest installer script and specify the version using an environment variable.

Control Plane Nodes:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=<GITHUB_VERSION_TAG> sh -a

Work Nodes:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_TOKEN=<TOKEN> K3S_URL=https://<MASTER_HOST>:6443 INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=<GITHUB_VERSION_TAG> sh -a

Verify that the upgrade worked.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ k3s --version

[10]

kind
~~~~

kind does not officially support upgrades. It was designed for developers to spin up new Kubernetes clusters temporarily for testing. However, it is technically possible to use ``kubeadm`` to upgrade each Node. [46]

Ingress Controllers
-------------------

The ``Ingress`` API requires at least one Ingress Controller to be installed. That controller creates a ``Service`` of type ``LoadBalancer`` using an external IP address that is available on all of the Nodes. Domain names should have their DNS resolve to that IP address.

The Ingress Controller will handle all incoming HTTP connections on port 80. It also supports handling TLS termination for incoming HTTPS connections on port 443. Custom layer 7 routing rules for the HTTP/S traffic can be defined via the API.

Other ports and protocols are not supported. Use a ``Service`` of type ``LoadBalancer`` or ``NodePort`` instead for applications that do not use HTTP or require a custom port. [58]

Popular Ingress controllers [57]:

-  Ambassador
-  Contour
-  HAProxy
-  Istio
-  Kong
-  NGINX
-  Traefik
-  Voyager

A full list of Ingress Controllers can be found `here <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/>`__.

Contour
~~~~~~~

Installation [63]:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
   $ helm repo update
   $ helm install contour bitnami/contour

NGINX
~~~~~

There are two different Ingress Controllers that use the NGINX reverse-proxy server: (1) ``kubernetes/ingress-nginx`` and (2) ``nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress``. The first one is the official Ingress Controller supported by the Kubernetes project. The second one is provided by NGINX, Inc. that adds more advanced features. [64]

kubernetes/ingress-nginx
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installation [65]:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
   $ helm repo update
   $ helm install ingress-nginx-kubernetes ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx

nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installation [66]:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ helm repo add nginx-stable https://helm.nginx.com/stable
   $ helm repo update
   $ helm install ingress-nginx-nginxinc nginx-stable/nginx-ingress

Traefik
~~~~~~~

Traefik provides features such as advancing routing, SSL/TLS certificate management, and LetsEncrypt support for automatically creating and signing new certificates. [43]

Installation [44]:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ helm repo add traefik https://helm.traefik.io/traefik
   $ helm repo update
   $ helm install traefik traefik/traefik
   $ helm history traefik

Concepts
--------

Container Network Interface (CNI) Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``kubelet`` service on each ``Node`` interacts with a CNI plugin to manage the network connections between Pods. The cloud operator must pick at least one plugin. For using more than one plugin, use the `Multus CNI project <https://github.com/intel/multus-cni>`__. Canal (both Calico and Flannel combined into a single plugin) is recommended for most use cases.

.. csv-table::
   :header: Plugin, Arm Support, Ease of Configuration, Resource Usage, Network Layer, Encryption, NetworkPolicy Support, Use Case
   :widths: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

   Calico, Yes, Medium, Low, 3, No, Yes, Highly configurable
   Canal, Yes, Medium, Low, 3, No, Yes, Combine the easiness of Flannel and the NetworkPolicy support of Calico
   Cilium, No, Easy, High, 3, No, Yes, BPF Linux kernel integration
   Flannel, Yes, Easy, Low, 2, No, No, Simple overlay network management
   kubenet, Yes, Easy,  Low, 2, No, No, Very basic Linux bridge management
   kube-router, Yes, Medium, Low, 3, No, Yes, Feature rich
   Weave Net, Yes, Hard, Medium, 3, No, Yes, Manage mesh networks
   Weave Net (Encrypted), Yes, Hard, High, 3, Yes, Yes, Secure networks

Recommended CNI plugins for each use case:

-  Proof-of-concept = kubenet. It is built into Kubernetes and does not require any additional setup.
-  Home lab = Flannel. Easy to setup and provides container network separation.
-  Work lab = Canal. It expands upond Flannel by adding support for other features such as the  NetworkPolicy API.
-  Encryption = Weave Net. Designed to be scalable and secure.

Legacy plugins that are no longer maintained:

-  Romana

[19][20]

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RBAC is enabled by default on a Kubernetes cluster by the ``kube-apiserver``.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kube-apiserver --authorization-mode=RBAC

There are four APIs that configure RBAC. Roles define what verbs (actions) are allowed. RoleBindings assign a Role to a user or, group or service account.

Namespaced APIs:

-  Role
-  RoleBinding

Non-namespaced APIs:

-  ClusterRole
-  ClusterRoleBinding

Common verbs:

-  create
-  delete
-  get (read)
-  update

Find out if the current user, or a different user, can run a specific command.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl auth can-i <VERB> <API>

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl auth can-i <VERB> <API> --as=<USER>

Commands can be run as a specific user or group:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl --as=<USER>

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl --as-group=<GROUP>

[56]

User Accounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A user is defined using the "common name" (CN) subject in a TLS certificate. The certificate is used instead of a password to authenticate to a Kubernetes cluster. Basic/password authentication was removed in Kubernetes 1.19. [61] The certificate must be signed by the Kubernetes certificate authority (CA).

-  Create a public and private key-pair for a new user.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ openssl genrsa -out <USER>.key 4096

-  Create a certificate signing request for the new user.

   -  Normal user:

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ openssl req -new -key <USER>.key -subj "/CN=<USER>" -out <USER>.csr

   -  Administrative user. Only use this if the certificate will be manually signed. The ``CertificateSigningRequest`` (CSR) API does not allow creating objects with the organization field set to "system:masters". Instead, create a normal user above and apply administrative privileges as part of the CSR and [Cluster]RoleBinding objects.

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ openssl req -new -key <USER>.key -subj "/CN=<USER>/O=system:masters" -out <USER>.csr

-  Create and sign the certificate either manually using the Kubernetes certificate authority (found on the Control Plane Nodes) or using the Kubernetes CSR API.

   -  Manually:

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ openssl x509 -req -in <USER>.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -out <USER>.crt

   -  CSR API:

      -  Use ``base64`` to encode the certificate key file into a string.

         .. code-block:: sh

            $ base64 -w 0 <USER>.csr

      -  Create a CSR object. Refer to `examples from the Kubernetes Development documentation about CSR <kubernetes_development.html#certificatesigningrequest>`__.
      -  The CSR will be in a ``Pending`` state until manually approved by an administrator user.

         .. code-block:: sh

            $ kubectl get csr <CSR_OBJECT_NAME>
            $ kubectl certificate approve <CSR_OBJECT_NAME>

      -  Extract the certificate file. If the CSR was valid, a ``csr.status.certificate`` field will be populated with the ``base64`` encoded certificate file.

         .. code-block:: sh

            $ kubectl get csr <CSR_OBJECT_NAME> --template={{.status.certificate}} | base64 -d > <USER>.crt

-  Unless the certificate was created manually with the ``/O=system:masters`` privileges, a [Cluster]Role and [Cluster]RoleBinding must be created for the user to assign permissions.
-  Find or create a role to use that will define the permissions the user has to the cluster.

    -  Find and use an existing ClusterRole (this can be used for a RoleBinding, not just a ClusterRoleBinding). For an administrator account, use ``cluster-admin`` for full access to everything or ``admin`` for full access only to the default APIs.

       .. code-block:: sh

          $ kubectl get clusterroles

   -  Or create a new [Cluster]Role.

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ kubectl create [cluster]role <ROLE_NAME> --verb=<VERB_1>,<VERB_2> --resource=<API_1>,<API_2>

-  Create a [Cluster]RoleBinding to grant the user those permissions.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ kubectl create [cluster]rolebinding --[cluster]role=<ROLE_NAME> --user=<USER> <ROLEBINDING_NAME>

[56][62]

-  Finally a user can authenticate to the cluster either via ``kubectl`` or manually via an HTTP request through a tool such as ``curl``. Verify that the new account is working as expected.

   1.  ``$HOME/.kube/config`` file.
   2.  ``curl``:

      2a.  Syntax: ``curl --cert <USER>.crt --key <USER>.key --cacert ca.crt https://<CONTROL_PLANE_IP>:6443/``
      2b.  Example: ``curl --cert <USER>.crt --key <USER>.key -k https://127.0.0.1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/``

TLS Certificate Creation (cert-manager)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cert-manager provides a set of APIs that assist in the manual and automatic creation of TLS certificates.

cert-manager.io/v1 APIs:

-  Certificate = Create a CertificateRequest and, if it processes correctly, a Secret object will be created containing the TLS certificate.
-  CertificateRequest = A request to cert-manager (either manually from the Certificate API or automatically by specifying ``ingress.metadata.annotations: cert-manager.io/clusterissuer: <CLUSTER_ISSUER>``) to automatically create a certificate.
-  ClusterIssuer = A cluster-wide provider of certificates. Common Issuers include selfSigned, CA, and ACME (Let's Encrypt).
-  Issuer = Namespaced Issuers.

acme.cert-manager.io/v1 APIs (used automatically by the CertificateRequest API):

-  Challenge = A DNS or HTTP challenge for ACME to prove that the domain is owned by the person making the request for a signed certificate.
-  Order = A request to ACME for a new certificate.

[60]

cert-manager installation [59]:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
   $ helm repo update
   $ helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --version v1.2.0 --create-namespace --set installCRDs=true
   $ kubectl --namespace cert-manager get pods

The process of managing certificates:

1.  Create a [Cluster]Issuer object once.
2.  Create a Certificate object using a [Cluster]Issuer for each domain that requires TLS encryption.
3.  Use the Certificate(s) in an Ingress or Gateway object(s).

Troubleshooting
---------------

Errors
~~~~~~

Error when installing Flannel with ``kubectl apply -f https://github.com/coreos/flannel/raw/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml``:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl -n kube-system describe pod kube-flannel-ds-rgzpn
   E0304 04:04:44.958281       1 main.go:292] Error registering network: failed to acquire lease: node "<NODE_HOSTNAME>" pod cidr not assigned

Solution:

-  Kubernetes was not installed with a Pod network CIDR assigned. For kubeadm, uninstall the cluster and reinstall with the argument: ``kubeadm --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16``.

----

CoreDNS container is stuck in the ``STATUS`` of ``ContainerCreating`` with the error message ``failed to find plugin "<PLUGIN>" in path [<PATH>]``.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl -n kube-system describe pod coredns-f9fd979d6-cr7p6
     Warning  FailedCreatePodSandBox  69s (x17 over 4m40s)  kubelet            (combined from similar events): Failed to create pod sandbox: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to setup network for sandbox "76c5c21331dd5998d9a6efd5ac6d74c45b10386db7d34555c7e0f22f5969ee13": failed to find plugin "loopback" in path [/usr/lib/cni]

Solutions:

-  The CNI plugins might be installed to a different path such as ``/opt/cni/bin/`` instead of ``/usr/lib/cni/``. Run this command to create a symlink to it: ``ln -s /opt/cni/bin /usr/lib/cni``.
-  If the CNI plugins are missing from the system, then download the source code, compile the plugins, and then copy them to the correct directory. [52]

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ git clone https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins.git
      $ cd plugins
      $ ./build_linux.sh
      $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/cni/ # Or use '/opt/cni/bin/'.
      $ sudo cp ./bin/* /usr/lib/cni/

----

CoreDNS container is stuck in ``STATUS`` of ``ContainerCreating`` with the error message ``error getting ClusterInformation: connection is unauthorized: Unauthorized``:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl -n kube-system describe pod coredns-f9fd979d6-72lh2
     Warning  FailedCreatePodSandBox  3m3s (x17 over 6m33s)  kubelet            (combined from similar events): Failed to create pod sandbox: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to setup network for sandbox "dcc4d29a213211977d0aa11195980a11533d722cfcd9ef11cf7b1385ef9dde10": error getting ClusterInformation: connection is unauthorized: Unauthorized

Solution:

-  Calico/Canal or another CNI plugin was uninstalled. CNI plugins usually leave configuration files on the system. Manually delete those files.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo rm -f /etc/cni/net.d/10-canal.conflist /etc/cni/net.d/calico-kubeconfig

----

``k3s`` keeps reporting the error ``x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid``:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo cat /var/log/syslog
   Mar 10 21:11:18 kube0 k3s[438]: E0310 21:11:18.648950     438 reflector.go:153] k8s.io/client-go/informers/factory.go:135: Failed to list *v1beta1.Event: Unauthorized

   Mar 10 21:11:18 kube0 k3s[438]: E0310 21:11:18.696824     438 authentication.go:104] Unable to authenticate the request due to an error: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid

Solutions:

-  The system time is set incorrectly.
-  Upgrade to >= ``v1.19.1+k3s1`` where certificate rotation was fixed.
-  Restart the ``k3s`` service. Once it starts, if it detects that a certificate is going to expire within 90 days or less, it will recreate the certificates.

   .. code-block:: sh

      # Control-plane Node
      $ sudo systemctl restart k3s
      # Worker Node
      $ sudo systemctl restart k3s-agent

-  The certificate has already expired. ``k3s`` will only rotate certificates that are about to expire (not ones that have expired). Manually set the date back to force the certificates to be regenerated.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ kubectl get nodes
      Unable to connect to the server: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid: current time 2021-03-10T21:34:56Z is after 2021-02-27T21:54:59Z

   .. code-block:: sh

      # Stop the 'k3s' (Control Plane) or 'k3s-agent' (Worker Node) service.
      $ sudo systemctl stop k3s
      # Manually set the date to be within 90 days before the certificate has expired.
      $ sudo date -s 20210220
      # Start k3s to rotate the certificates.
      $ sudo systemctl start k3s
      # Verify it works now.
      $ kubectl get nodes
      # Stop k3s.
      $ sudo systemctl stop k3s
      # Set the date back manually. Or use a time synchornization program such as 'chronyd' or 'ntpd'.
      $ sudo date -s 20210310

----

Error ``use of <SIGNER_NAME> signer with system:masters group is not allowed`` when creating a CertificateSigningRequest object:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl apply -f csr-user-foobar.yaml
   Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "csr-user-foobar.yaml": certificatesigningrequests.certificates.k8s.io "csr-user-foobar" is forbidden: use of kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client signer with system:masters group is not allowed

Solutions:

-  Manually create/sign the certificate with ``openssl`` and the Kubernetes CA.
-  Or use ``openssl`` to generate a new certificate signing request that does not include ``/O=system:masters``.
