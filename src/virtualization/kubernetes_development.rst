API
---

Stability
~~~~~~~~~

New Kubernetes APIs go through a life-cycle of updates before being marked as stable. Below are the different possible stages in ascending order.

-  Development or Prototype = Not found in any official releases. May not work.
-  Alpha = Partially implemented. Disabled by default. Versioning starts with ``v1alpha1``.
-  Beta = Feature complete. Includes mostly completed API test coverage. Upgrades may break. Versioning starts with ``v1beta1``.
-  Stable or General Availability (GA) = Fully supported in Kubernetes. Will remain backwards compatible with upgrades. Versioning starts with ``v1``.

[4]

Types
~~~~~

All of the available APIs are categorized into these types:

-  Cluster
-  Config and Storage
-  Metadata
-  Service
-  Workloads

[5]

Resources
~~~~~~~~~

Resource APIs are used to create objects in Kubernetes. They define the desired state of objects. Controllers are used to enforce that state. Every object manifest has the following fields. Typically these are defined declaratively via a YAML manifest file.

-  **apiVersion (string)** = The version of the API. Normally ``v1`` or ``<APIGROUP>/v1``.
-  **kind (string)** = Name of the API to create an object from.
-  **metadata (dictionary)** = Metadata for the object.

   -  **name (string)** = The unique name of this object. Only one object with this Resoure kind and name can exist in a namespace.
   -  **labels (dictionary)** = Any key-value pair to help identify this object. This is optional but recommended to help find specific or related objects.

-  **spec (dictionary)** = Provide information on how this object will be created and used. Valid inputs are different for every API. Not all APIs will have a spec.
-  status = The current state information for the object. This can be shown via ``kubectl get <RESOURCE_API> <OBJECT> -o yaml``.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   apiVersion: <RESOURCE_APIGROUP>/<RESOURCE_APIVERSION>
   kind: <RESOURCE_KIND>
   metadata:
     name: <OBJECT_NAME>
     labels:
       <KEY>: <VALUE>
   spec:

[6]

List the values for each Resource such as the ``<NAME>``, ``<APIGROUP>``, ``<KIND>``, and if it supports namespaces. Further documentation on all of the available configuration fields for a Resource can also be shown.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl api-resources
   $ kubectl explain <RESOURCE_NAME>
   $ kubectl explain <RESOURCE_NAME>.spec --recursive
   $ kubectl explain <RESOURCE_NAME> --recursive

View the ``<RESOURCE_APIGROUP>/<RESOURCE_APIVERSION>`` versions available to use.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl api-versions

Show all objects from one of the Resource APIs.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl get <RESOURCE_NAME>

View details about an object.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl describe <RESOURCE_NAME> <OBJECT_NAME>

[7]

Edit or view the YAML configuration for an existing object.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl edit <RESOURCE_NAME> <OBJECT_NAME>
   $ kubectl get <RESOURCE_NAME> <OBJECT_NAME> -o yaml --export

Create a basic template for a Deployment or any object. It can be saved and used as a starting point for a new template. No object will be created.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl run <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> --image=<CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME> --dry-run -o yaml
   $ kubectl create <RESOURCE_NAME> <OBJECT_NAME> --dry-run -o yaml

[8]

Imperative and Declarative Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Imperative

   -  `commands <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/imperative-command/>`__ = Using only the CLI (no configuration file) to create and manage resources. Syntax: ``kubectl run`` for Pods and ``kubectl create <RESOURCE_API>`` for most other resources.
   -  `object configuration <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/imperative-config/>`__ = Using the CLI and an existing configuration file/directory to create and manage resources. Syntax: ``kubectl {create,delete,get,replace} -f <FILE>.yaml``.

-  Declarative

   -  `object configuration <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/declarative-config/>`__ = Directly apply a configuration and change it's state using a manifest file. Syntax: ``kubectl {apply,diff} -f <FILE>.yaml``.

A YAML file can be used to define an object that will be created using an API resource. This is commonly called a manifest, definition, declarative, or an object configuration file. Once it has been applied it becomes a live object configuration that is stored in Kubernetes back-end database. It is recommended to use declarative objects because they can be easily tracked and updated through a source code management (SCM) such as git. [9]

**Run Generators**

In Kubernetes < 1.19, the imperative command ``kubectl run`` would create a Deployment. It could optionally be used to create a Pod instead.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl run <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> --image=<IMAGE>
   kubectl run --generator=deployment/apps.v1 is DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future version. Use kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 or kubectl create instead.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 <POD_NAME> --image=<IMAGE>

In Kubernetes >= 1.19, the command can only create a Pod. This is to align the command with the functionality of ``docker run``.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl run <POD_NAME> --image=<IMAGE>

[10]

API Resources
-------------

Each section lists the following information:

-  <API_GROUP>

   -  <API_RESOURCE> = <DESCRIPTION>

A manifest file can be created to use the resource following this format:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   apiVersion: <GROUP>/<API_VERSION>
   kind: <API_RESOURCE>
   metadata:
     name: <NAME>
   spec:

Information about every API can be found be using the ``kubectl explain`` command, viewing the `API Reference Docs <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/>`__, or viewing the `Kubernetes Documentation <https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/>`__.

Workloads
~~~~~~~~~

Workload APIs manage running applications. [5]

-  apps

   -  DaemonSet = Manages Kubernetes Pods that run on worker nodes. Objects created using this API are usually for logging or networking.
   -  Deployment = Uses both the Pod and ReplicaSet API along with managing the life-cycle of an application. It is designed for stateless applications.
   -  ReplicaSet = New API for manging replicas that has support for label selectors.
   -  StatefulSet = Similar to a Deployment except it can handle persistent storage along with ordered scaling and rolling updates. Each new Pod created will have a new persistent volume claim created (if applicable). [1]

-  batch

   -  CronJob = Schedule Pods to run at specific intervals of time.
   -  Job = A one-time execution of a Pod.

-  core

   -  Pod = The smallest API resource that can be used to create containers.
   -  ReplicationController = Older API for managing replicas. [11]

Most applications should use the Deployment or the StatefulSet API due to the collection of features it provides.

Concepts
--------

Popular APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are common Kubernetes APIs used by developers [12]:

-  ConfigMap
-  CronJob
-  DaemonSet
-  Deployment
-  HorizontalPodAutoscaler
-  Ingress
-  Job
-  PersistentVolumeClaim
-  Pod
-  ReplicaSet
-  Secret
-  Service
-  StatefulSet
-  VerticalPodAutoscaler

Labels and Annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Labels and annotations both provide a way to assign a key-value pair to an object. This can later be looked up by other objects and by administrators. Labels help to organize related objects and perform actions on them. Many APIs support using a selector to lookup and bind to objects with labels that are found. Helm has a variety of labels that it recommends. [27] Annotations are similar except they are meant for non-human processing.

Define labels and annotations in the metadata section of a manifest.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   metadata:
     annotations:
       <KEY>: <VALUE>
     labels:
       <KEY>: <VALUE>

View all labels in use.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl get all --show-labels

View all objects with a specific label.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl get all -l "<KEY>=<VALUE>"

Namespaces
~~~~~~~~~~

Namespaces help to isolate objects. Common use cases include having one application per Namespace or one team per Namespace.

View what APIs do and do not support being created inside a Namespace. Any resource that does not support a Namespace is globally accessible [26], such as a PersistentVolume.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ kubectl api-resource --namespace=true
   $ kubectl api-resource --namespace=false

An object can declaratively bind itself to a Namespace by specifying it in the metadata.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   metadata:
     namespace: <NAMESPACE_NAME>

Persistent Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, all storage is emphemeral. The PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) APIs provide a way to persistently store information for use-cases such as databases. A PV defines the available storage and connection details for the Kubernetes cluster to use. A PVC defines the storage allocation for use by a Pod.

The example below shows how to configure static storage for a Pod using a directory on a Worker Node.

-  Create a PV. Set a unique ``<PV_NAME>``, use any name for storageClassName, configure the ``<PV_STORAGE_MAX>`` gigabytes that the PV can allocate, and define the ``<LOCAL_FILE_SYSTEM_PATH>`` where the data from Pods should be stored on the Worker Nodes. In this scenario, it is also recommended to configure a ``nodeAffinity`` that restricts the PV from only being used by the Worker Node that has the local storage.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   kind: PersistentVolume
   apiVersion: v1
   metadata:
     name: <PV_NAME>
   spec:
     storageClassName: <STORAGE_CLASS_NAME>
     capacity:
       storage: <PV_STORAGE_MAX>Gi
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     hostPath:
       path: "<LOCAL_FILE_SYSTEM_PATH>"
     nodeAffinity:
       required:
         nodeSelectorTerms:
           - matchExpressions:
             - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
               operator: In
               values:
                 - <WORKER_NODE_WITH_LOCAL_FILE_SYSTEM_PATH>

-  Create a PVC from the PV pool. Set a unique ``<PVC_NAME>`` and the ``<PVC_STORAGE>`` size. The size should not exceed the maximum available storage from the PV. To bind to the previously created PV, use the same ``<STORAGE_CLASS_NAME>``

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   apiVersion: v1
   metadata:
     name: <PVC_NAME>
   spec:
     storageClassName: <STORAGE_CLASS_NAME>
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: <PVC_STORAGE>Gi

-  Create a Pod using the PVC. Set ``<POD_VOLUME_NAME>`` to a nickname of the PVC volume that will be used by the actual Pod and indicate the ``mountPath`` for where it should be mounted inside of the container.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   kind: Pod
   apiVersion: v1
   metadata:
     name: <POD_NAME>
   spec:
     volumes:
       - name: <POD_VOLUME_NAME>
         persistentVolumeClaim:
           claimName: <PVC_NAME>
     containers:
       - name: mysql
         image: mysql:8.0
         volumeMounts:
           - mountPath: "/var/lib/mysql"
             name: <POD_VOLUME_NAME>

[3]

Service and Ingress (Public Networking)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two APIs for managing networking in Kubernetes: Service (internal) and Ingress (external). A Service by itself is used to expose access to a Pod and ports in it for development and testing purposes. There are various different types of services. Most can be managed by ``kubectl expose``.

ServiceTypes [22]:

-  ClusterIP = Opens a port and exposes it on an internal IP that can only be accessed on Nodes (no external connectivity). Internally in Kubernetes, requests to ``<SERVICE>.default.svc.cluster.local`` will be redirected to this IP address. The port is only open on the Nodes which have the related Pod running.
-  NodePort = Opens a port on every Node (even if a Pod it is tied to is not on it). Connectivity can be made through the IP address of the Nodes that have the Pod running.
-  LoadBalancer = Use a third-party cloud provider's load balancing service.
-  ExternalName = Similar to a ClusterIP except a domain name can be given. ``kubectl expose --type=ExternalName`` currently `does not work <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/87398>`__ because there is no argument for the external name.

Ingress is used to publicily expose a Pod and it's ports. It can redirect traffic based on domain names and HTTP paths. It also supports creating load balancers and handling SSL/TLS termination. It requires a Service to bind to. [23]

Ingress Controllers are different back-ends that handle the Ingress API. They use different technologies and generally have their own use-cases. The only ones that are officially supported are NGINX and Google's Compute Engine (GCE).

Top 5 Ingress Controllers and their top use-cases [24]:

-  Ambassador = API gateway.
-  HAProxy = Load balancing.
-  Istio Ingress Gateway = Fast performance.
-  NGINX = Automatic public cloud integration.
-  Traefik = Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS generation.

A Kubernetes cluster can have more than one Ingress Controller installed. In an object's manifest, the one to use can be specified. [25]

Kubernetes < 1.19 ``ingress.metadata.annotations.kubernetes.io/ingress.class``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   metadata:
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/ingress.class: <INGRESS_CONTROLLER>

Kubernetes >= 1.19 ``ingress.spec.ingressClassName``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   metadata:
     annotations:
       # Some Ingress Controllers still require the legacy
       # annotation to process special rules.
       kubernetes.io/ingress.class: <INGRESS_CONTROLLER>
   spec:
     ingressClassName: <INGRESS_CONTROLLER>

Helm (Package Manager)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes applications. Helm 2 and below required a Tiller server component to be installed on the Kubernetes cluster. This is no longer required as of Helm 3. Helm is now a standalone client-side-only command. [15]

Vocabulary:

-  Chart = A Helm package with all of the related resource manifests to run an application.
-  Repository = A collection of Charts that can be installed.
-  Release = A unique name given each time a Chart is installed. This is used to help track different installations and the history of a Helm Chart.

`Helm Hub <https://hub.helm.sh/>`__ is the official repository for Helm Charts. There are currently over one thousand Charts available. Third-party repositories are also supported. Helm can even install Charts from a directory (such as a local git repository). [16]

Each Chart contains a "values.yaml" for manifest settings that can be overridden. It is expected that it contains sane defaults and can be deployed without any modifications. The manifest files are `Go templates <https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/>`__ that get rendered out based on the values provided to Helm. `The Chart Template Developer's Guide <https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/>`__ explains in more detail how to fully customize templates. It is possible to override values that are not templated, or to add new ones, by using `Kustomize <https://kustomize.io/>`__. The biggest downside to using Kustomize is that Helm no longer has visibility into the release/life-cycle of a Chart. [17]

Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Probes
^^^^^^

There are three types of health probes for a Pod. At a minimum, a liveness probe should be configured for every Pod.

-  liveness = Determine if the application is still working as expected. If this probe fails, the Pod is restarted.
-  readiness = Determine if the application is available and should accept connections. If this probe fails, network connections to the Pod will be temporarily paused.
-  startup = Determine if the application has fully started (once at startup). If this probe fails, the Pod is marked as failed.

For a full list of configuration options, see the `Probe <#probe>`_ section.

The ``kubectl`` command is used to manage Kubernetes objects. The binary version can manage a Kubernetes cluster of the same version and the previous minor release. [13]

Installation:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cd ~/.local/bin/
   $ export KUBE_VER="1.18.3"
   $ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v${KUBE_VER}/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
   $ chmod +x ./kubectl
   $ kubectl version --client

::

   Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"18", GitVersion:"v1.18.3", GitCommit:"2e7996e3e2712684bc73f0dec0200d64eec7fe40", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-05-20T12:52:00Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.9", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

By default, the configuration file (provided by the Kubernetes cluster administrator) will be loaded from the file ``~/.kube/config``. This can be set to a different file. [14]

.. code-block:: sh

   $ export KUBECONFIG="<PATH_TO_KUBE_CONFIG>.yml"
   $ kubectl config view
   $ kubectl cluster-info
   $ kubectl version

helm (CLI)
~~~~~~~~~~

Find the latest version from `Helm's GitHub releases page <https://github.com/helm/helm/releases>`__. [18]

Installation:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ export HELM_VER="3.2.2"
   $ curl -LO https://get.helm.sh/helm-v${HELM_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
   $ tar -x -f helm-v${HELM_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
   $ cp linux-amd64/helm ~/.local/bin/
