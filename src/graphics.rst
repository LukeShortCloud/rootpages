AMD
---

AMD provides an open-source driver that is part of the Linux kernel. For the best experience, use the latest stable Linux kernel.

Nvidia
------

Fedora
~~~~~~

If the official Nvidia installer was originally used then those libraries need to be cleaned up.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo rm -f /usr/lib{,64}/libGL.so.* /usr/lib{,64}/libEGL.so.*
   $ sudo rm -f /usr/lib{,64}/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so
   $ sudo dnf reinstall xorg-x11-server-Xorg mesa-libGL mesa-libEGL libglvnd\*
   $ sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.saved

The the unofficial Nvidia driver RPMs can be installed. Starting with Fedora 27 [2], the RPMFusion repository can be officially enabled and used to manage the driver.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo dnf install fedora-workstation-repositories
   $ sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled rpmfusion-nonfree-nvidia-driver
   $ sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia akmod-nvidia vdpauinfo libva-vdpau-driver libva-utils vulkan

nvidia-xrun
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an unofficial utility for running an application or window manager on a different TTY that uses the dedicated Nvidia graphics card. This is useful for laptops as it removes the need to deal with Nvidia Optimus technology, provides a way to run games that require the Vulkan library, and fields better performance.

Install the Nvidia graphics driver, Bumblebee, OpenBox (``openbox`` and ``obmenu`` packages), and `nvidia-xrun <https://github.com/Witko/nvidia-xrun>`__. Bumblebee is optionally used to turn the graphics card off and on. OpenBox is the most common window manager to use.

Configure `bbswitch` kernel module from Bumblebee to handle power management of the Nvidia card. File: ``/etc/modprobe.d/bbswitch.conf``.

::

   bbswitch
   options bbswitch load_state=0 unload_state=1

Set nvidia-xrun to launch OpenBox.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ echo "openbox-session" >> ~/.nvidia-xinitrc

Switch to a free TTY. This is normally done in Linux by pressing ``CTRL`` + ``ALT`` + ``F2``. Log in and then run ``nvidia-xrun``. OpenBox will now be running with full access to the Nvidia graphics card.
