User Account Control (UAC)
--------------------------

UAC ensures that all applications are run as a normal user account with no escalated privileges. When an application tries to run as Administrator, UAC will prompt the user and ask if they want to run with Administrator privileges. [3] This feature was first introduced in Windows Vista. [4]

Disable
~~~~~~~

For users who often need to use the Administrator account, it may be desired to disable UAC entirely.

-  Windows 11 and 10

   -  Control Panel (Control Panel) > User Accounts > User Accounts > Change User Account Control settings > Never notify

Process Monitor
---------------

Usage
~~~~~

Process Monitor is an official tool from Microsoft. It is useful to see what a process is doing for security or troubleshooting purposes. Newer versions also support Linux.

-  Download and extract `Process Monitor <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon>`__.
-  Run ``Procmon64.exe``.
-  By default, it captures all events immediately. Clear this before managing filters.

    -  File > Capture Events
    -  Edit > Clear Display

-  Add one or more filters using the `example filters <#example-filters>`__ as a starting point.
-  Press the Capture button (an arrow facing right). Inside the icon, a sub-icon will change from a pause icon (two bars) to a recording icon (red dot).
-  When done, press the Capture button again to pause the montioring.
-  Save the output in a common text file format for easier parsing.

   -  File > Save... > Format: Comma-Separated Values (CSV)  > OK
