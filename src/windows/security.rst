User Account Control (UAC)
--------------------------

UAC ensures that all applications are run as a normal user account with no escalated privileges. When an application tries to run as Administrator, UAC will prompt the user and ask if they want to run with Administrator privileges. [3] This feature was first introduced in Windows Vista. [4]

Disable
~~~~~~~

For users who often need to use the Administrator account, it may be desired to disable UAC entirely.

-  Control Panel > User Accounts > User Accounts > Change User Account Control settings > Never notify
