Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously known as the long-term servicing branch (LTSB) in older releases of Windows, LTSC provides a stripped down version of Windows Enterprise. It removes pre-installed applications including:

-  Cortana
-  Edge web browser
-  Microsoft Store
-  Onedrive
-  Skype

Major updates (including hardware support) only come every two to three years. Every release receives security updates for 10 years.

-  Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2016
-  Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019
-  Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021

An installation of the non-LTSC Windows 10 Enterprise edition can use the traditional "current" update channel which recieves two major updates every year. Alternatively, it can use the "LTSC" update channel.
