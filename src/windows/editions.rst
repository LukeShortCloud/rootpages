Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously known as the long-term servicing branch (LTSB) in older releases of Windows, LTSC provides a stripped down version of Windows Enterprise. It removes pre-installed applications including:

-  Cortana
-  Edge web browser
-  Microsoft Store
-  Onedrive
-  Skype

Major updates (including hardware support) only come every two to three years. Every release receives security updates for 10 years.

-  Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2016
-  Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019
-  Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021

[3]

An installation of Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC can switch to the traditional "current" update channel which recieves two major updates every year. This essentially turns it into Windows 10 Enterprise. However, downgrading Windows 10 Enterprise to Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC is not supported. [4]
