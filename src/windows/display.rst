HDR
---

High Dynamic Range (HDR) media provides more realistic colors. HDR support requires a supported graphics device, driver, monitor, and video cable. [1]

Enable HDR10
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows 10 and 11 natively support the open HDR10 standard. Starting with Windows 11, it supports auto HDR that converts a list of specific legacy games to use HDR. This is a feature first added to the Xbox Series consoles. [2]

Windows 11

-  Settings (ms-settings:) > System > Display > Use HDR > Use HDR: On, HDR video streaming: On, Auto HDR: On

Windows 10

-  Settings (ms-settings:) > System > Display  > Use HDR: On

Enable Dolby Vision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dolby Vision is not natively supported on Windows. It requires installing various Microsoft Store apps on either Windows 10 or 11. [3]

Microsoft Store apps:

-  HEVC codec = Paid. Required to decode Dolby Vision video files.
-  Dolby Vision Extensions = Free. Required to add Dolby Vision support to Windows.
-  Dolby Access = Free trial. Optional for playing Dolby Vision video files. This also provides support for Digital Theater Sound (DTS) and Dolby Atmos surround sound.
