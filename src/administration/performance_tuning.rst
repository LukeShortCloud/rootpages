Linux Kernel Version
--------------------

Using the latest stable `upstream Linux kernel <https://kernel.org/>`__ provides the best performance. Despite claims of custom kernels providing enhanced performance, benchmarks show that in most cases they are still not as fast as the upstream Linux kernel. [1] The LTS Linux kernel is slower and does not support newer hardware compared to the latest stable version but it is more stable. [2]
