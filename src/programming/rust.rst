Introduction
------------

Rust is faster and more power efficient than C++ [3] while also being more secure. It is designed to provide memory, null, thread, and type safety. The compiler refuses to build unsafe code and provides detailed hints on how to fix it. [4] Memory exploits alone lead to anywhere from 50-90% of all known vulnerabilities. [5][6]
