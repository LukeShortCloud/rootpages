Machine Learning

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Use Cases
---------

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). It is great for making predictions based on historical data. [1]

Use-cases:

-  Image recognition

   -  Identifying objects in an image.

-  Natural language processing (NLP)

   -  Understanding written or vocal speech.

-  Recommendation engines

   -  Predicting what similar products a user might like.

Mathematics
-----------

Machine learning does not always require having a deep knowledge of math. When it is needed, these are the most relevant mathematical subjects a machine learning expert should be familiar with [2][3]:

-  Linear algebra
-  Statistics
-  Differential calculus
-  Integral calculus

Programming Languages
---------------------

More than half of all machine learning programs are built using Python. [4] Here are the top 3 programming languages used [4][5]:

1.  Python
2.  R
3.  Java

Graphics Card Vendors
---------------------

NVIDIA provides the best support for machine learning with its proprietary CUDA library. It is possible to use AMD and Intel graphics cards by using the open source OpenCL library [7] but NVIDIA provides the best performance and compatibility. [6]
