Wires
-----

Colors
~~~~~~

Each country has a different standard for the purpose of each colored wire. In the United States of America, these are the standards [2]:

-  Hot

   -  **Black**
   -  Blue
   -  Brown
   -  Yellow
   -  Red = High voltage up to 240 volts.
   -  Orange = Very high voltage up to 480 volts.

-  Neutral

   -  **White** = High voltage up to 240 volts.
   -  Grey = Very high voltage up to 480 volts.

-  Ground

   -  **Green**
   -  Bare wire (no covering)

Relays
------

A relay is a switch that controls power being sent through a wire or circuit. It is either normally open (NO) or normally closed (NC) when there is power sent through a contact in relay. When there is no power through a contact, a NO gate will turn off and a NC gate will turn on.

There are two types of relays: electromechanical relays (EMR) and solid-state relays (SSR). EMR uses magnets to move a physical switch. SSR uses circuits to direct electricity.

EMR:

-  State of the relay is more reliable.

   -  It is either on or off.

-  Requires more power to change the state.
-  Slower switching.
-  More likely to break.
-  Replaceable parts.
-  Moving parts.

SSR:

-  State of the relay is less reliable.

   -  It is somewhere between on and off but leans towards one or the other.

-  Requires less power to change the state.
-  Faster switching.
-  Less likely to break.
-  Non-replaceable parts.
-  No moving parts.
