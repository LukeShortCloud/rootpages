Relays
------

A relay is a switch that controls power being sent through a wire or circuit. It is either normally open (NO) or normally closed (NC) when there is power sent through a contact in relay. When there is no power through a contact, a NO gate will turn off and a NC gate will turn on.

There are two types of relays: electromechanical relays (EMR) and solid-state relays (SSR). EMR uses magnets to move a physical switch. SSR uses circuits to direct electricity.

EMR:

-  State of the relay is more reliable.

   -  It is either on or off.

-  Requires more power to change the state.
-  Slower switching.
-  More likely to break.
-  Replaceable parts.
-  Moving parts.

SSR:

-  State of the relay is less reliable.

   -  It is somewhere between on and off but leans towards one or the other.

-  Requires less power to change the state.
-  Faster switching.
-  Less likely to break.
-  Non-replaceable parts.
-  No moving parts.
