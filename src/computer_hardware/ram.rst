==========================

Recommended Size
----------------

Depending on the use-case, these are the recommended total size of system RAM to have.

Gaming [1][4]:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Use-case, RAM (GB)
   :widths: 20, 20

   Very old games (Windows XP), 4
   Old games (Windows 7), 8
   Modern games (Windows 10), 16

Video editing [2]:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Resolution, RAM (GB)
   :widths: 20, 20

   720p, 8
   1080p, 16
   4K, 32
   8K, 64

Machine learning (ML) [3]:

.. csv-table::
   :header: ML Workload, RAM (GB)
   :widths: 20, 20

   Minimum, 32
   Recommended, 64
   Maximum, 128

-  The RAM in a system for ML should be at least twice as much as the VRAM on the GPU. It is recommended to also round up to the closest interval of 32 GB of RAM. [3]
