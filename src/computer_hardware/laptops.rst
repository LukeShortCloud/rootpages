Graphics Cards
--------------

NVIDIA
~~~~~~

For the best experience, get a laptop with at least an `Intel Coffee Lake (Intel Core >= 9000 series) CPU <https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/codename/97787/coffee-lake.html>`__ and a `NVIDIA Turing (GeForce RTX >= 2000 series) GPU <https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/turing/>`__. These are the minimum requirements for automatic power management of the graphics card which will greatly increase battery life. The integrated Intel GPU is used until an application is specifically ran with offloading to the NVIDIA GPU. [1]
