Wi-Fi
-----

Brands
~~~~~~

These are Wi-Fi chipset manufacturers from order of best to worst Linux support [2]:

1.  Mediatek
2.  Qualcomm
3.  Intel
4.  (Other brands)
5.  Realtek

`morrownr <https://github.com/morrownr>`__ created a `USB Wi-Fi guide <https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi/blob/main/home/USB_WiFi_Adapters_that_are_supported_with_Linux_in-kernel_drivers.md>`__ that showcases consumer Wi-Fi devices that use chipsets that are natively supported by the Linux kernel.

Broadcom
^^^^^^^^

Broadcom has many different Linux kernel drivers. ``brcm80211`` is the official open source driver that Broadcom contributed directly to the Linux kernel. The proprietary driver ``wl`` provides better and more stable support. [5]

-  Install the ``wl`` driver.

   -  Arch Linux [5]:

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ sudo pacman -S linux-headers broadcom-wl

   -  Debian (non-free repository) [6]:

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ sudo apt-get install linux-image-$(uname -r) linux-headers-$(uname -r) broadcom-sta-dkms

   -  Fedora (UnitedRPMs repository) [7]:

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ sudo dnf install kernel-devel kernel-headers broadcom-wl-dkms

-  Blacklist all of the open source drivers and conflicting drivers. [5][6][8]

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo -E ${EDITOR} /etc/modprobe.d/broadcom.conf

   ::

      blacklist b43
      blacklist b43legacy
      blacklist bcm43xx
      blacklist bcma
      blacklist brcm80211
      blacklist brcmsmac
      blacklist brcmfmac
      blacklist brcmutil
      blacklist ndiswrapper
      blacklist ssb
      blacklist tg3

-  Configure the ``wl`` driver to load on boot.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo -E ${EDITOR} /etc/modules-load.d/broadcom.conf

   ::

      wl

-  Reboot.

Speed
~~~~~

These are the maximum speeds for each Wi-Fi standard [3][4]:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Consumer Name, IEEE Name, Specification Speed (Mbps), Real-World Speed (Mbps), Real-World Speed (MBps)
   :widths: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

    Wi-Fi 1, 802.11b, 11, 5.5, 0.7
    Wi-Fi 2, 802.11a, 54, 20, 2.5
    Wi-Fi 3, 802.11g, 54, 20, 2.5
    Wi-Fi 4, 802.11n, 600, 100, 12.5
    Wi-Fi 5, 802.11ac, 1300, 740, 92.5
    Wi-Fi 6, 802.11ax (5 GHz), 10000, 1150, 143.8
    Wi-Fi 6E, 802.11ax (6 GHz), 10000, 1800, 225.0

Virtualization
