Resolution
----------

The resolution is the amount of pixels displayed onto a screen. The higher the resolution, the more that can be displayed.

Common resolution sizes (width x height):

-  1280 x 720 = 720p or High Definition (HD)
-  1366 x 768 = 768p
-  1920 x 1080 = 1080p or Full High Definition (FHD)
-  2560 x 1440 = 1440p
-  3840 x 2160 = 2160p or 4K
-  7680 x 4320 = 4320p or 8K

Size
~~~~

Each resolution has an optimal monitor size. Below lists the recommended size to buy and the maximum size where a difference will be noticed when sitting 24" away from a monitor. All sizes are in inches. [5]

.. csv-table::
   :header: Resolution, Recommended Size, Maximum Size
   :widths: 20, 20, 20

   1080p, 24, 23
   1440p, 27, 30.5
   2160p, 32, 46

For laptops, 1080p is the ideal resolution. 4K and even 2K resolution makes the text too small and the screen sizes are not big enough to take full advantage of higher resolutions. The higher the resolution, more battery life is also drained. [6]

Panel Technology
----------------

Every monitor uses a panel technology. This is a large factor in determining the quality and features of the monitor.


.. csv-table::
   :header: Panel Technology, Price\*, Viewing Angles, Contrast Ratio, Color Accuracy, Reponse Time\*
   :widths: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

   In Plane Switching (IPS), High, High, Medium, High, High
   Vertical Alignment (VA), Medium, Medium, High, Medium, Medium
   Twisted Nematic (TN), Low, Low, Low, Low, Low

\*= Lower is better.

Color Accuracy
--------------

The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1976 chromaticity diagram is used as a standard for digital color spaces. It represents all visible colors that a human eye can see in a three-dimensional diagram. Different color spaces exist that cover a percentage of the CIE 1976 standard. [1]

.. csv-table::
   :header: Color Space, Percentage of Human Visible Colors, Use Case
   :widths: 20, 20, 20

   Adobe Wide Gamut RGB, 77.6, Professional film recorders
   Rec. 2020, 75.8, Professional movies 
   Adobe RGB, 52.1, Printing
   DCI-P3, 41.7, HDR movies and video games
   sRGB (Rec. 709), 35.9, Digital photos and videos

For color accuracy, it is recommended for the general consumer to buy a monitor with 100% sRGB coverage. For HDR content, near 100% coverage of DCI-P3 is desired. Rec. 2020 is slowly becoming more popular for HDR content but is not widely available.

[2][3][4]

Contrast Ratio
--------------

Contrast ratios are the difference between the darkest and lightest color a monitor can produce. There are two types: static and dynamic. Static ratios are the most important. It represents the difference with the monitor settings unchanged for checking the darkest and lightest color. Most monitors that do not use OLED cannot reach higher than a 1000:1 static contrast ratio. Manufacturers normally use dynamic ratios in their marketing which provides an inaccurate view. Dynamic ratios unfairly compare the brightness difference with the monitor set at two different settings. [8]

High Dynamic Range (HDR)
------------------------

HDR provides a standard for color accuracy and high contrast. Only video games and movies created with HDR can fully utilize all of the features of a HDR TV. For official qualification, a TV must meet these requirements: [9]

-  4K Resolution
-  10-Bit Color Depth
-  Wide Color Gamut (WCG)

   -  >= 90% of DCI-P3

-  Brightness

   -  Over 1000 nits (and have better whites)
   -  Or over 540 nits (and have better blacks)

Only mid- to high-end TVs support the brightness and WCG. Most low-end TVs do not meet all of the requirements to display true HDR content. Many companies have their own technology for helping to deliever WCG colors. [10]

Proprietary WCG backlight technologies:

-  Nano Cell (LG)
-  QLED (Samsung)
-  Triluminos (Sony)
