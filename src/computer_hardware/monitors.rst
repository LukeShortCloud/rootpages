Color Accuracy
--------------

The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1976 chromaticity diagram is used as a standard for digital color spaces. It represents all visible colors that a human eye can see in a three-dimensional diagram. Different color spaces exist that cover a percentage of the CIE 1976 standard. [1]

.. csv-table::
   :header: Color Space, Percentage of Human Visible Colors, Use Case
   :widths: 20, 20, 20

   Adobe Wide Gamut RGB, 77.6, Professional film recorders
   Rec. 2020, 75.8, Professional movies 
   Adobe RGB, 52.1, Printing
   DCI-P3, 41.7, HDR movies and video games
   sRGB (Rec. 709), 35.9, Digital photos and videos

For color accuracy, it is recommended for the general consumer to buy a monitor with 100% sRGB coverage. For HDR content, near 100% coverage of DCI-P3 is desired. Rec. 2020 is slowly becoming more popular for HDR content but is not widely available.
