Resolution
----------

The resolution is the amount of pixels displayed onto a screen. The higher the resolution, the more that can be displayed.

Common resolution sizes [15]:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Abbreviation, Width x Height, Megapixels (MP), Name
   :widths: 20, 20, 20, 20

   720p, 1280 x 720, 0.9, High Definition (HD)
   768p, 1366 x 768, 1
   1080p, 1920 x 1080, 2.1, Full HD (FHD)
   1440p, 2560 x 1440, 4, 2K
   2160p, 3840 x 2160, 8.5, 4K Ultra HD (UHD)
   4320p, 7680 x 4320, 33.2, 8K UHD

The full human eye can see up to 576 megapixels. [16] However, a human can actually only consciously comprehend up to 15 megapixels. [17]

Size
~~~~

Each resolution has an optimal monitor size. Below lists the recommended size to buy and the maximum size where a difference will be noticed when sitting 24" away from a monitor. All sizes are in inches. [5]

.. csv-table::
   :header: Resolution, Recommended Size, Maximum Size
   :widths: 20, 20, 20

   1080p, 24, 23
   1440p, 27, 30.5
   2160p, 32, 46
   4320p, 48, 92

For laptops, 1080p is the ideal resolution. 4K and even 2K resolution makes the text too small and the screen sizes are not big enough to take full advantage of higher resolutions. The higher the resolution, more battery life is also drained. [6]

Panel Technology
----------------

Every monitor uses a panel technology. This is a large factor in determining the quality and features of the monitor.


.. csv-table::
   :header: Panel Technology, Price\*, Viewing Angles, Contrast Ratio, Color Accuracy, Response Time\*
   :widths: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

   In Plane Switching (IPS), High, High, Medium, High, High
   Vertical Alignment (VA), Medium, Medium, High, Medium, Medium
   Twisted Nematic (TN), Low, Low, Low, Low, Low

\*= Lower is better.

[7]

Color Accuracy
--------------

The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1976 chromaticity diagram is used as a standard for digital color spaces. It represents all visible colors that a human eye can see in a three-dimensional diagram. Different color spaces exist that cover a percentage of the CIE 1976 standard. [1]

.. csv-table::
   :header: Color Space, Percentage of Human Visible Colors, Use Case
   :widths: 20, 20, 20

   Adobe Wide Gamut RGB, 77.6, Professional film recorders
   Rec. 2020, 75.8, Professional movies 
   Adobe RGB, 52.1, Printing
   DCI-P3, 41.7, HDR movies and video games
   sRGB (Rec. 709), 35.9, Digital photos and videos

For color accuracy, it is recommended for the general consumer to buy a monitor with 100% sRGB coverage. For HDR content, near 100% coverage of DCI-P3 is desired. Rec. 2020 is slowly becoming more popular for HDR content but is not widely available.

[2][3][4]

Contrast Ratio
--------------

Contrast ratios are the difference between the darkest and lightest color a monitor can produce. There are two types: static and dynamic. Static ratios are the most important. It represents the difference with the monitor settings unchanged for checking the darkest and lightest color. Most monitors that do not use OLED cannot reach higher than a 1000:1 static contrast ratio. Manufacturers normally use dynamic ratios in their marketing which provides an inaccurate view. Dynamic ratios unfairly compare the brightness difference with the monitor set at two different settings. [8]

Brightness
----------

The brightness of monitors and TVs are measured in nits (cd/m^2). The higher the nits, the higher it's brightness is. A bright monitor is easier to see in a well-lit room or outdoors. [12] When buying a TV, it is most important to consider the brightness level when seeing if it supports true HDR. That feature usually requires at least 1000 nits. [9]

High Dynamic Range (HDR)
------------------------

HDR provides a standard for color accuracy and high contrast. Only video games and movies created with HDR can fully utilize all of the features of a HDR TV. For official qualification, a TV must at least meet these minimum requirements: [9]

-  4K Resolution
-  10-Bit Color Depth
-  Wide Color Gamut (WCG)

   -  >= 90% of DCI-P3

-  Brightness

   -  Over 1000 nits (and have better whites)
   -  Or over 540 nits (and have better blacks)

Only mid- to high-end TVs support the brightness and WCG. Most low-end TVs do not meet all of the requirements to display true HDR content. Many companies have their own technology for helping to deliver WCG colors. [10]

Proprietary WCG backlight technologies:

-  Nano Cell (LG)
-  QLED (Samsung)
-  Triluminos (Sony)

There are different certification standards for HDR. The color bit depth determines how many colors can be displayed. Having dynamic metadata allows for different HDR settings on each individual frame or scene for a better optimized viewing experience. Static metadata sets the HDR settings once for the entire video. [20]

.. csv-table::
   :header: Standard, Standard Type, Industry Support, Color Bit Depth, Metadata, Brightness Minimum, Brightness Maximum
   :widths: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

   HDR10, Open, High, 10, Static, 1000 nits, 4000 nits
   HDR10+, Open and royalty-free, Low, 10, Dynamic, 1000 nits, 4000 nits
   Dolby Vision, Proprietary, Medium, 12, Dynamic, 4000 nits, 10000 nits

Computer operating systems have partial support for HDR. Most applications do not natively support it. Windows 10 and Netflix require buying Microsoft's HEVC Video Extension for video playback streaming to work. [11]

Color Depth
-----------

Every monitor has a color depth that determines how many colors it can display.

.. csv-table::
   :header: Bits of Color Depth, Bits Per Pixel, Number of Colors, HDR
   :widths: 20, 20, 20, 20

   8, 24, 16 million, SDR
   10, 30, 1 billion, HDR10 and HDR10+
   12, 36, 68 billion, Dolby Vision

[21][22]

Some monitors use 8-bit color depth with Frame Rate Control (FRC) to provide fake 10-bit support. This is also known as 8-bit with dithering. It smooths the transition of colors from one pixel to the next to make the colors appear more natural and to reduce banding. [23]

Refresh Rate
------------

Most monitors can display video up to 60 Hz (60 frames per second). A monitor with a high refresh rate will have decreased motion blur and lower input lag. The monitor will look smoother and be more responsive. This is most useful when playing competitive video games. [13]

Common refresh rates (Hz):

-  60
-  120
-  144
-  240

Variable refresh rate (VRR) is when the monitor dynamically changes it's refresh rate to match the content that is being played. This prevents screen tearing and provides even smoother playback. There are two standards for implementing this: FreeSync (AMD) and G-SYNC (NVIDIA). All FreeSync monitors support both AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards. Most G-SYNC monitors from 2020 and beyond are compatible with both AMD and NVIDIA graphics card. [14]

The human eye can identify objects at 220 Hz. Above that frequency, a human can at least notice flickers. [18] Theoretically, a human can perceive beyond 1000 Hz. [19]

Human Vision
------------

With modern day technology, it is almost possible to reproduce the image quality that human eyes can comprehend. The specifications for a theoretical monitor would be:

-  8K resolution
-  100% of the Rec. 2020 color spectrum
-  Dolby Vision HDR

   -  10,000-nit brightness
   -  12-bit color depth

-  240 Hz

Movie Formats
-------------

Here is a comparison between all physical movie formats.

.. csv-table::
   :header: Name, Resolution, HDR Support [24], Video Codec Support, Maximum Format Size
   :widths: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20

   4K UHD Blu-ray, 4096x2160 [25], Yes, H.265 (HEVC) and VP9, 100 GB
   1080p HD Blu-ray, 1920x1080, No, "H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC), H.262 (MPEG-2), and SMPTE VC-1 [26]", 50 GB
   480p DVD, 720x480, No, H.262 (MPEG-2), 8.5 GB
