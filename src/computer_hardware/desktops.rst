Used Workstations
-----------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Used workstations can be found for cheap (under $100). Look for workstations that have an Intel Xeon processor (E5-1650 v2 or newer). Those high-end processors still work well for productivity and gaming today. [3]

Brand and series [1][2]:

-  Dell Precision

   -  Example models: T3600 or T600.

-  HP Z

   -  There are two variants: the normal desktop "tower" and the "small form factor" (SSF). The tower normally has twice as much wattage as the SSF and includes a 6-pin PCIe power cable for a GPU.
   -  Example models: Z420, Z440, Z620, or Z820.

-  Lenovo ThinkStation

   -  Example model: S30.

Recommended Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  RAM

   -  At least 16 GB of RAM is recommended for modern gaming. Get a complete kit of RAM as workstations do not always allow using different variants of RAM sticks.
   -  Workstation and server processors normally require error correction code (ECC) RAM.

-  GPU = Due to limited wattage, consider getting a GPU that can be powered by `just the PCIe slot <graphics_cards.html#pcie-power-only>`__.
-  CPU = Find which processors the workstation support. The selection may be smaller than what the motherboard typically supports. Purchase the best possible CPU that is compatible and the current cooling system supports. For the best results, swap out the CPU for one that uses the same wattage.
-  NVMe drive = NVMe drives provide the fastest performance. For older workstations that do not have NVMe, a PCIe slot adapter can be purchased. Then the drive can be set up as a secondary drive for applications and games.
-  Network interface card = A PCIe 2.5 Gbps Ethernet or Wi-Fi 6E adapter can be purchased to increase the network connection speed.
