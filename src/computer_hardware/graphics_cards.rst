Recommended VRAM Size
---------------------

Depending on the use case, these are the recommended minimum size of VRAM to have on the graphics card.

Gaming [1][2]:

   720p, 2
   1080p, 4
   1440p, 6
   4K, 8

Video editing [2][3]:

   1080p, 4
   4K, 6
   6K, 8
   8K, 10

Machine learning (ML) [4][5]:

   Minimum, 8
   Recommended, 24
   Maximum, 48

-  The amount of VRAM differs based on the type of ML model. Language models use the most amount of VRAM compared to image models which are more CPU-bound rather than GPU-bound. [5]

Integrated GPUs (iGPUs) can use up to half of the available system RAM. [6] Since RAM is slower than VRAM, it is recommended to use the fastest RAM available. [7]
