3-2-1
~~~~~

The principles of the 3-2-1 backup philosophy help to effectively backup data. That data can be recovered in a worst-case scenario where one or two backups may be corrupted or lost.

-  3 = Keep three backups of a file.
-  2 = Keep two backups on different storage devices.
-  1 = Keep one backup in a remote location.

These are the absolute minimum. More backups can be used as needed. [1]
